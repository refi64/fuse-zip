By default high precision timestamp is saved to archive only for new
files or files with known creation time. You can force high-precision time
saving by specifying '-o force_precise_time' option. In this case creation time
will be equal to a first known file modification time.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B fuse\-zip
is a FUSE filesystem, that enables any program to work with a ZIP archive as though it is a plain directory.
Unlike KIO or Gnome VFS, it can be used in any application without modifications.

Unlike other FUSE filesystems, only fuse\-zip provides write support to ZIP archives.
Also, fuse\-zip is faster than all known implementations on large archives with many files. 

Since version 0.3.0 fuse-zip has support for absolute and parent-relative paths
in file names, but only in read-only mode (-r command line switch). Absolute
paths are displayed under "ROOT" directory, every ".." in path replaced by "UP"
in directory name and "normal" files are placed under "CUR" directory.

Support for UNIX file permissions and owner information has been added in
version 0.4.0. See
.B PERMISSIONS
for details.

Since version 0.5.0 fuse-zip forces open in read-only mode if archive file or
its parent directory is not writable.

File/archive comments are supported since version 0.7.0. To read/modify file
comment use extended attribute "user.comment". Archive comment is accessible
via mount point's extended attribute.

If you want to specify character set conversion for file names in archive,
use the following fusermount options:

  \-omodules=iconv,from_code=$charset1,to_code=$charset2

See FUSE documentation for details.

.SH "USAGE"
General usage would look like this

.TS
tab (@);
l l.
1@mkdir\ /tmp/zipArchive
2@fuse\-zip foobar.zip /tmp/zipArchive
3@(do something with the mounted file system)
4@fusermount \-u /tmp/zipArchive
.TE
.PP
Be patient. Wait for fuse-zip process finish after unmounting, especially on a big archives.
.SH "PERMISSIONS"
Access check will not be performed unless
\fB-o default_permissions\fP mount option is given.
